# The Burnup Model, Old and New

This repository contains several variants of the Burnup wildfire fuel combustion model.  The orignal model was first documented in the report:

*Program BURNUP, a simulation model of the burning of large woody natural fuels.  
Frank A. Albini  
Missoula, MT: USDA Forest Service. Unpublished report. Research Grant INT-92754-GR. 1994.  
Appendix B.*

and the subsequent papers:

*Albini, F.A. and Reinhardt, E.D.  
Modeling ignition and burning rate of large woody natural fuels.  
International Journal of Wildland Fire 5(2): 81-91, 1995.*

*Albini, F.A., Brown, J.K., Reinhardt, E.D. and Ottmar, R.D.  
Calibration of a large fuel burnout model.  
International Journal of Wildland Fire 5(3): 173-192, 1995.*

This repository contains an annotated version of the original source code, which is in archaic fixed form Fortran, as well as versions that we have updated to modern Fortran.  An R interface will be added later.

This remains a work in progress with code verification ongoing.  Further documentation can be found in the code for the time being.
